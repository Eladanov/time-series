# Time series features

```{r}
library(fpp3)
```


## Some simple tatistics
```{r}
tourism |>
  features(Trips, list(mean = mean)) |>
  arrange(mean)
```
```{r}
tourism |> features(Trips, quantile)
```



## ACF Features
```{r}
tourism |> features(Trips, feat_acf)
```
the first autocorrelation coefficient from the original data;
the sum of squares of the first ten autocorrelation coefficients from the original data;
the first autocorrelation coefficient from the differenced data;
the sum of squares of the first ten autocorrelation coefficients from the differenced data;
the first autocorrelation coefficient from the twice differenced data;
the sum of squares of the first ten autocorrelation coefficients from the twice differenced data;
For seasonal data, the autocorrelation coefficient at the first seasonal lag is also returned.



## STL Features
```{r}
tourism |>
  features(Trips, feat_stl)
```
```{r}
tourism |>
  features(Trips, feat_stl) |>
  ggplot(aes(x = trend_strength, y = seasonal_strength_year,
             col = Purpose)) +
  geom_point() +
  facet_wrap(vars(State))
```
holiday series are most seasonal which is unsurprising

```{r}
tourism |>
  features(Trips, feat_stl) |>
  filter(
    seasonal_strength_year == max(seasonal_strength_year)
  ) |>
  left_join(tourism, by = c("State", "Region", "Purpose"), multiple = "all") |>
  ggplot(aes(x = Quarter, y = Trips)) +
  geom_line() +
  facet_grid(vars(State, Region, Purpose))
```




## Other features



## Exploring Australian tourism data
```{r}
tourism_features <- tourism |>
  features(Trips, feature_set(pkgs = "feasts"))
tourism_features
```
```{r}
library(glue)
tourism_features |>
  select_at(vars(contains("season"), Purpose)) |>
  mutate(
    seasonal_peak_year = seasonal_peak_year +
      4*(seasonal_peak_year==0),
    seasonal_trough_year = seasonal_trough_year +
      4*(seasonal_trough_year==0),
    seasonal_peak_year = glue("Q{seasonal_peak_year}"),
    seasonal_trough_year = glue("Q{seasonal_trough_year}"),
  ) |>
  GGally::ggpairs(mapping = aes(colour = Purpose))
```
```{r}
library(broom)
pcs <- tourism_features |>
  select(-State, -Region, -Purpose) |>
  prcomp(scale = TRUE) |>
  augment(tourism_features)
pcs |>
  ggplot(aes(x = .fittedPC1, y = .fittedPC2, col = Purpose)) +
  geom_point() +
  theme(aspect.ratio = 1)
```

```{r}
outliers <- pcs |>
  filter(.fittedPC1 > 10) |>
  select(Region, State, Purpose, .fittedPC1, .fittedPC2)
outliers
```

```{r}
outliers |>
  left_join(tourism, by = c("State", "Region", "Purpose"), multiple = "all") |>
  mutate(Series = glue("{State}", "{Region}", "{Purpose}", .sep = "\n\n")) |>
  ggplot(aes(x = Quarter, y = Trips)) +
  geom_line() +
  facet_grid(Series ~ ., scales = "free") +
  labs(title = "Outlying time series in PC space")
```





















## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
