# Time series decomposition

```{r}
library(fpp3)
```

## Transformations and adjustments
```{r}
global_economy |>
  filter(Country == "Australia") |>
  autoplot(GDP / Population)
```
```{r}
food <- aus_retail |>
  filter(Industry == "Food retailing") |>
  summarise(Turnover = sum(Turnover))
food |> autoplot(Turnover)
```
```{r}
food |> autoplot(sqrt(Turnover)) + 
  labs(y = "square root turnover")
```
```{r}
food |> autoplot((Turnover)^1/3) + 
  labs(y = "cube root turnover")
```
```{r}
food |> autoplot(log(Turnover)) + 
  labs(y = "log  turnover")
```
```{r}
food |>
  features(Turnover, features = guerrero)
```



## Time series components














## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
